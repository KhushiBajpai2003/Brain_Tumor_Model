# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to detect brain tumors from medical imaging data. The model has been trained on a dataset of brain MRI scans and can classify images as either tumor-positive or tumor-negative. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, and details on how to use the model.


# Project Overview
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be life-threatening. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to aid in the detection of brain tumors from MRI scans.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of brain MRI images labeled as either containing a tumor or being normal. The dataset should be organized into two main directories: train and test, each containing subdirectories tumor and normal.


# Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project is built using the following layers:

Convolutional Layers
Max Pooling Layers
Fully Connected Layers
Dropout Layers
The architecture is designed to effectively capture spatial hierarchies in MRI images and accurately classify them.


# Usage
To use the trained model for prediction, ensure you have a trained model file (model.h5). You can use the following script to make predictions on new MRI images:

# Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using the following command:

# Results
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Detailed performance metrics are provided in the evaluation script output.
